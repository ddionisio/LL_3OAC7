    "lesson_1_mult2_1": "In multiples of two, the trick is to simply double the number.",
    "lesson_1_mult2_2": "For example: 2 x 6 can be 6 + 6, which equals to 12.",
    "lesson_1_commutative_1": "The commutative property means that multiplying numbers in any order gives the same answer.",
    "lesson_1_commutative_2": "For example: 2 x 3 and 3 x 2 equal 6.",
    "lesson_1_commutative_3": "With this trick, you only have to remember half the multiplication table!",
    "lesson_1_tutorial_1": "Now banish these blobs by connecting them in the correct order using multiplication.",
    "lesson_1_tutorial_end_1": "Excellent! You are now ready for the mission!",
    "lesson_2_intro_1": "Good work! Now it's time to step up the game with multiples of 3 and 4, along with division.",
    "lesson_2_intro_2": "Let me show you some neat tricks.",
    "lesson_2_mult3_1": "In multiples of three: double the number, and then add the original number.",
    "lesson_2_mult3_2": "For example, 3 x 6: double 6 to get 12, and then add 6 to get 18.",
    "lesson_2_mult4_1": "In multiples of four: double the number, and then double it again.",
    "lesson_2_mult4_2": "For example, 4 x 6: double 6 to get 12, and then double 12 to get 24.",

    "lesson_3_intro_1": "So far so good! Now it's time to go over the multiples of 5 and 6.",
    "lesson_3_mult5_1": "There are several ways to go about with multiples of 5.",
    "lesson_3_mult5_2": "You can count in fives, alternating between 0's and 5's.",
    "lesson_3_mult5_3": "Or, you can multiply the number by 10, and then half it.",
    "lesson_3_mult6_1": "In multiples of 6, a good approach is to first multiply the number by 5, then add the original number.",
    "lesson_3_mult6_2": "For example, 6 x 7: multiply 7 by 5 to get 35, and then add 7 to get 42.",
    "lesson_3_associative_1": "The associative property means that we can group any of the numbers in the equation.",
    "lesson_3_associative_2": "Numbers that are grouped together will be calculated first.",
    "lesson_3_associative_3": "This trick is useful in multiplication if you want to split up a large number into several multiples.",
    "lesson_3_associative_4": "Remember that unlike multiplication, division is not associative.",
    "lesson_3_end_1": "Now let us proceed to the next mission!"
