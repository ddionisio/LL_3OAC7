    "lesson_1_intro_1": "Before we proceed, let's first learn some tricks with multiplication!",
    "lesson_1_mult2_1": "In multiples of two, the trick is to simply double the number.",
    "lesson_1_mult2_2": "For example: 2 x 6 can be 6 + 6, which equals to 12.",
    "lesson_1_commutative_1": "The commutative property means that multiplying numbers in any order gives the same answer.",
    "lesson_1_commutative_2": "For example: 2 x 3 and 3 x 2 equal 6.",
    "lesson_1_commutative_3": "With this trick, you only have to remember half the multiplication table!",
    "lesson_1_tutorial_1": "Now banish these blobs by connecting them in the correct order using multiplication.",
    "lesson_1_tutorial_end_1": "Excellent! You are now ready for the mission!",
    "lesson_2_intro_1": "Good work! Now it's time to step up the game with multiples of 3 and 4, along with division.",
    "lesson_2_intro_2": "Let me show you some neat tricks.",
    "lesson_2_mult3_1": "In multiples of three: double the number, and then add the original number.",
    "lesson_2_mult3_2": "For example, 3 x 6: double 6 to get 12, and then add 6 to get 18.",
    "lesson_2_mult4_1": "In multiples of four: double the number, and then double it again.",
    "lesson_2_mult4_2": "For example, 4 x 6: double 6 to get 12, and then double 12 to get 24.",
    "lesson_2_div_1": "When it comes to division, think of it as the opposite of multiplication.",
    "lesson_2_div_2": "Rearranging the equation, and replacing division with multiplication can help.",
    "lesson_2_div_3": "Unlike multiplication, division is not commutative. So the order of the numbers cannot be changed.",
    "lesson_2_tutorial_1": "For the next mission, some blobs must be matched with division. Go ahead and try it out.",
    "lesson_2_tutorial_end_1": "Excellent! You are now ready for the mission!",
    "lesson_3_intro_1": "So far so good! Now it's time to go over the multiples of 5 and 6.",
    "lesson_3_mult5_1": "There are several ways to go about with the multiples of 5.",
    "lesson_3_mult5_2": "You can count in fives, alternating between 0's and 5's.",
    "lesson_3_mult5_3": "Or, you can multiply the number by 10, and then half it.",
    "lesson_3_mult6_1": "In multiples of 6, a good approach is to first multiply the number by 5, and then add the original number.",
    "lesson_3_mult6_2": "For example, 6 x 7: multiply 7 by 5 to get 35, and then add 7 to get 42.",
    "lesson_3_associative_1": "The associative property means that we can group any of the numbers in the equation.",
    "lesson_3_associative_2": "Numbers that are grouped together will be calculated first.",
    "lesson_3_associative_3": "This trick is useful in multiplication if you want to split up a large number into several multiples.",
    "lesson_3_associative_4": "Remember that unlike multiplication, division is not associative.",
    "lesson_3_end_1": "Now let us proceed to the next mission!",
    "lesson_4_intro_1": "We are almost there! Let's take a look at some tricks for the multiples of 7 and 8.",
    "lesson_4_mult7_1": "In multiples of 7, a good trick is to multiply the number by 5, and then add the original number twice.",
    "lesson_4_mult7_2": "If you have mastered the multiples of 6: multiply the number by 6, and then add the original number.",
    "lesson_4_mult8_1": "In multiples of 8: double the number three times.",
    "lesson_4_mult8_2": "For example, 8 x 4: double 4 to get 8, double 8 to get 16, and finally double 16 to get 32.",
    "lesson_4_distributive_1": "The distributive property allows you to distribute a number to a group.",
    "lesson_4_distributive_2": "For multiplication, this is a good trick for splitting up a number, and computing each one separately.",
    "lesson_4_distributive_3": "As they say: when an obstacle is too large to handle, divide and conquer.",
    "lesson_4_end_1": "Now onwards to the next mission!"
